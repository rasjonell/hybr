## Services

Hybr comes with the following default services but can be extended with other services(refer to Adding Custom Services)
- Tiny Tiny RSS (tt-rss): *Self-hosted news feed aggregator*
- Nextcloud: *Personal Cloud Provider*

## Adding Custom Services

Hybr uses a simple service definition, so you can add any service you want. To add a new service, you need to:

1.  Create a new directory for your service in the service templates directory.
2.  Create a `docker-compose.yml` file and any other necessary configuration files for your service.
3.  Update the `service.json` file that describes the services to Hybr. See `/internal/services/templates/services.json` for more details.
4.  Run `hybr init`
